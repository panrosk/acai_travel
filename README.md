# üåç Multi-Agent Travel Planner

This project is a streaming backend API built in Go using the Fiber framework that powers an AI-assisted travel planning experience using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). The system simulates multiple AI agents (destination expert, budget planner, trip synthesizer) working together to provide rich travel recommendations in real-time.

---

## üß† Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Implements a multi-step agent reasoning system.
- **Streaming Responses:** Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time LLM outputs.
- **LLM Provider Abstraction:** Works with OpenAI (can be extended to other providers).
- **Prompt Injection System:** Custom prompts per agent with safe variable injection.
- **Clean Hexagonal Architecture:** Clear separation between handlers, use cases, domain, and adapters.
